Trivia Game

In this Trivia game, JavaScript was used for the logic and jQuery was used to manipulate the HTML. CSS was used to add style to the pages.
When the user clicks on the Start button, the timer starts counting down from 60 to 0.  The user must answer as many of the questions as possible while the clock is running.  When the timer hits 0, the user can no longer play because the radio buttons become disabled.  When the user clicks on the Done button, they are taken to a page with the game results.  The results show how many questions they got correct and how many they got wrong as well as how many they didn't answer.
